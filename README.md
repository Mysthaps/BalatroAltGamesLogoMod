## Installing the mod

1. Download and install, [Steammodded 1.0.0 beta 1224a](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta-1224a) and [Lovely v0.7.1](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector)
2. Download the  GameLogoMod_v0.1.1.zip  file from [Releases](https://github.com/CountKiro/BalatroAltGamesLogoMod/releases/tag/v0.1) on the right menu, extract it and then place it in your Mods folder. You'll know it's correct if you open the GameLogoMod folder and there's an assets folder and a .lua and .json file inside
3. [OPTIONAL] Go to Mods -> Game Logo Mod -> Options -> change the settings if you want a fixed logo or randomized
